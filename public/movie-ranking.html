<h1>Best Movies according to Puja</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Whisper Of The Heart</h3>
<p>It's a light-hearted, slice-of-life movie. I love the where the female lead works hard in trying to write a book to know if she is a good writer or if she needs to study more. Like working hard for something to know yourself better.</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>The movie shows that bad times are what makes the happy times really significant.</p>
<h3>Dear Zindagi</h3>
<p>A beautiful and introspective film.</p>
